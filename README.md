## Overview

This challenge helped me understand CSS Grid layout. I worked a lot to learn the basics of Grid.

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Working with Grid will be easy if you open the dev tool and see the Grid lines. Besides the layout, the HTML and choosing semantic elements was another challenge!
